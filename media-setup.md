It seems like it should be possible to do most of our media consumption from a
small Linux-based media PC.

I'm trying to figure out roughly how you could.

Apparently [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) has [support for
Netflix](https://www.comparitech.com/kodi/watch-netflix-on-kodi-18/) and
[Amazon Prime
Video](https://www.techfollows.com/kodi/install-amazon-prime-video-on-kodi/),
though both of those seem a little fiddly to configure.

If I do the configuration process using Ansible or Nix/Guix, then it should
work semi-indefinitely.

There is a thing called a [Media Center Edition
remote](https://kodi.wiki/view/Using_an_MCE_remote) which can work with Kodi
