This file contains program concepts I find interesting, but am not sure I
actually want to use.


A platform for publishing anonymously, with support for retroactively
unveiling yourself as the author. By requiring the public half of a
single-use key pair at initial submission, the original author can
retroactively claim authorship by publicly releasing a signed claim to
authorship.


A RESTish HTTP API for receiving messages, usable as a backwards-compatible
alternative to email. I'm not sure I actually like this idea - it's just an
interesting thought. If it's open-source, anyone can bring up an instance and
use a URL as their point of contact, with an email address that just forwards
to the API's backend. API instance could offer a message submission form, as
well as your mailchecking API. Could you do something in the API design to help
solve the spam problem? I don't understand the spam problem well enough to
answer that question... Mailgun is not unrelated to this concept, but is not
exactly what I'm thinking of: http://www.mailgun.com/
