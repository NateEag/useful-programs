Open-source software I wish existed (and would welcome discovering):

A program to filter style/static checker results to only report on changed
lines in a diff. In-progress at https://github.com/NateEag/diff-check.

A distributed command-line code review system that integrates cleanly with
native git, with an optional web UI for ease-of-use. It should support tracking a
branch's entire history (including rebases) without requiring extra
abstractions (like Gerrit's Changeset-Id). Some haphazard design notes on how
it might be built are at https://github.com/NateEag/git-revue.

A real-time audio synthesis engine that runs on general-purpose computing
hardware and intelligently scales up number of simultaneous patches/polyphony
based on available hardware resources.
