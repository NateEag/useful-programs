Software I wish existed and would welcome discovering. I strongly prefer open
source, but closed source is often better than nothing:


A program to run queued tasks when an internet connection becomes active. I
mainly want this so I can schedule git pushes while working without a
connection. This one isn't so esoteric - it must be possible, but I am,
unsurprisingly, writing this desire down while without an internet connection,
so I can't go looking.


A program to filter style/static checker results to only report on changed
lines in a diff. In-progress at https://github.com/NateEag/diff-check.


An HTML/CSS/JS style checker that warns you when a construct is not supported
by a browser the project targets. The data backing caniuse should make this
possible, but it could be fairly complex to adapt it to work with HTML/CSS/JS
parsers.


A distributed command-line code review system that integrates cleanly with
native git, with an optional web UI for ease-of-use. It should support tracking a
branch's entire history (including rebases) without requiring extra
abstractions (like Gerrit's Changeset-Id). Some haphazard design notes on how
it might be built are at https://github.com/NateEag/git-revue.


A real-time audio synthesis engine that runs on general-purpose computing
hardware and intelligently scales up number of simultaneous patches/polyphony
based on available hardware resources.
