Software I wish existed and would welcome discovering. I strongly prefer open
source, but closed source is often better than nothing:


A real-time audio synthesis engine that runs on general-purpose computing
hardware and intelligently scales up number of simultaneous patches/polyphony
based on available hardware resources.
[TessellationOS](http://tessellation.cs.berkeley.edu/) could be an excellent OS
to implement this system on, if/when it reaches a public release. This one I
really would require open-source for - what I want is for the patches I design
to never become unplayable. You can see my scribbled notes on this concept at
https://github.com/NateEag/audio-engine.


A better version control system than Git/Mercurial/et al. See
https://github.com/NateEag/next-vcs for my slow-evolving thoughts on the
subject.


A distributed command-line code review system that integrates cleanly with
native git, with an optional web UI for ease-of-use. It should support tracking
a branch's entire history (including rebases) without requiring extra
abstractions (like Gerrit's Changeset-Id). Some haphazard design notes on how
it might be built are at https://github.com/NateEag/git-revue.


An open source, local-first calorie tracker (but with optional support for
hitting servers for specific data). I initially thought of this as an Android
app, but perhaps it would be better conceived of as a network API (HTTP, I
assume, because that's what I know) which has both desktop and mobile UIs. The
mobile UI can't be a pure website because I want to support scanning barcodes
for branded foods, pulling the data from the free USDA branded food products DB
(which can be downloaded so you can use it in a local-first app).


An introduction to the basics of RESTful APIs in the form of a text-based
adventure. Support the HTTP verbs as commands, and have the player manipulate
the world to achieve victory conditions. I need to think of a scenario where
object creation and destruction makes sense... Maybe make the player a god of
some sort?


A program to filter style/static checker results by lines added and changed
in the diff between commits. In-progress at
https://github.com/NateEag/diff-check.


A really good schema exploration UI, something interactive and immediate that
is both pretty and functional. In particular, I make heavy use of formal
comments in my schemas, and none of the ones I've encountered handle that at
all well.


An HTML/CSS/JS style checker that warns you when a construct is not supported
by targeted browsers. The data backing caniuse should make this possible
(https://github.com/fyrd/caniuse), but it could be fairly complex to adapt it
to work with HTML/CSS/JS parsers. check-caniuse might be an okay name?
check-browser-compat?


A program that takes two SQL schemas and outputs the SQL to convert one to the
other. Call it schema-diff. Liquibase has parts of this, but it's not clear to
me that schema-diff as such is there (see potential-technologies.txt).


A two-player web-based implementation of the Kriegspiel chess variant. This
probably would be easy to write, but it's a low priority, given all the other
things I want to bang out.
